## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various **Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms** along with experiments and applications. The aim is to provide a comprehensive learning environment for understanding **model-free and model-based RL techniques**, their practical implementations, and their performance on standard benchmark environments.

The repository includes:
- Implementation of **classic RL algorithms** such as Q-learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient methods, Actor-Critic, and more.
- Use of **OpenAI Gym** and other simulation environments to test and visualize RL agents.
- Jupyter notebooks for **step-by-step explanations** and interactive learning.
- Scripts for **training and evaluating RL models**.

## Key Features
- **Well-structured RL implementations** for better understanding and experimentation.
- **Support for OpenAI Gym environments** (CartPole, MountainCar, LunarLander, Atari Games, etc.).
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning models** using PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- **Hyperparameter tuning and benchmarking** for different RL algorithms.
- **Pre-trained models** for quick testing and evaluation.
- **Visualization tools** to analyze training progress.
